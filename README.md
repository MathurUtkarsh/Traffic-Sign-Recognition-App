# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-App

# What is Traffic Signs Recognition?
There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

# Traffic Signs Recognition â€“ About the Project
In this project, I had build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

# Dataset - 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

Note - You can apply this project to any country's traffic signs according to your needs and dataset you have. I have done this project on German traffic Sign Recognition because I find it's dataset easily.

Steps to Build the Python Project

1.) To get started with the project, download the dataset and extract it into a folder.

2.) Fork this repo into same folder.

3.) Check for traffic_signs.py and run that notebook on your machine.

4.) If you want to simplify your task then you can use my pretrained weights file.
